## About Me

I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur with a track record of shipping production AI/ML systems that deliver measurable business outcomes. My work spans fraud detection engines, diagnostic AI platforms, and B2B marketplace infrastructure—always with a focus on architecture, scalability, and real-world impact.

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed a diagnostic AI system that outperformed specialist doctors by 60%+
- Built a fraud detection engine that improved profit-margin accuracy by 30%
- Secured data partnerships with S&P Global EMEA and TÜBİTAK 1812 grant funding
- Led cross-functional engineering teams from architecture through deployment

Currently based in Istanbul, Turkey, balancing a Computer Software Engineering degree at Doğuş University with active entrepreneurial ventures.
